# Release checklist (Phase 6, #24)

Owner-side runbook for the first store submissions. The native UI and shared
engine compile on Android locally and iOS through Codemagic. Unchecked items
require portal access, device testing, or store configuration.

## Android (Play)

- [ ] On a device: start a campaign, queue an action, close the app, reopen it,
  finish a turn, and confirm the same campaign and event queue resume.
- [ ] Play Console: create the app and first non-consumable products, then fill
  `SkuTable.entries` (`billing/SkuTable.kt`). Supply the license key as
  `MOV_PLAY_PUBLIC_KEY` through a build environment or Gradle property.
- [ ] Sandbox: purchase → refund → restore → reinstall → offline refresh,
  per docs/billing.md. Refunds must drop the pack on the next
  `queryPurchases`; a stale cache entry past grace must not re-grant
  (covered by `EntitlementsTest`, proven on device here).
- [ ] RTDN endpoint on the campaign server (web repo): revocation ->
  entitlement drop. Until it exists, refunds land on the next client check.
- [ ] Listing: title, short/full description, screenshots (tile map + EV bar
  + results), feature graphic, content rating questionnaire, privacy policy
  URL, data-safety form (no account, no ads SDK; Sentry crash reports only
  when a DSN is set).
- [ ] Release build with `MOV_SENTRY_DSN` set; verify a test crash arrives in
  Sentry before promoting to production.
- [ ] Attach gate evidence (gates 1-6 in README) to the Hub work item.

## iOS (App Store)

Apple Developer Program benefits are temporarily disabled while the team's
membership migration processes (case `102973233199`). App IDs, profiles,
and App Store Connect apps cannot be created until Apple restores access.
The owner will resume portal setup when the migration completes.

- [ ] Apple Developer: register the explicit iOS App ID
  `com.lakesidegames.electioneer` in the existing team. In-App Purchase is
  enabled by default for an explicit App ID.
- [ ] Apple Developer: create an **App Store Connect** distribution profile
  for that App ID using the existing Apple Distribution certificate (expires
  2027-09-10). Download its `.mobileprovision` file. Codemagic already has
  the matching certificate and App Store Connect API key in its encrypted
  `mov-signing` group; the profile is the one missing signing input.
- [ ] App Store Connect: create the iOS app record for that bundle ID with
  name `Margin of Victory`, English primary language, and an internal SKU
  such as `MOV-IOS-001`. The record must exist before Codemagic can upload.
- [ ] Run Codemagic `ios-testflight` on the reviewed commit with
  `MOV_REVIEW_COMMIT` set to its full SHA. Confirm a signed IPA uploads and
  reaches Apple's `VALID` processing state. The workflow does not submit
  to App Review; assign the build to internal testers after processing.
- [ ] On a device: repeat the campaign close/reopen test and verify the shared
  save restores through the SwiftUI session.
- [x] macOS verify: Codemagic `ios-verify` fully passed for the native
  campaign menu, setup, dashboard, and results at
  `600e4f77fb591620bed1bb384d33ac0542e41f99` (build
  `6ab9644bccabf1ff83f8db61`). This workflow does not sign or publish.
- [ ] App Store Connect: products matching the SKU table, sandbox +
  TestFlight exercise of purchase/restore/refund through `StoreKitAdapter`.
- [ ] App Store Server Notifications endpoint on the campaign server (web
  repo) for refunds/revocations.
- [ ] sentry-cocoa via SPM + DSN (Android hook `MovApp` is the pattern to
  mirror; not added blind from Linux).
- [ ] Listing: screenshots, privacy manifest + nutrition label (gameplay
  only, no tracking), TestFlight beta notes, crash-free gate.
- [ ] Attach gate evidence per platform to the Hub work item.

## Launch-safe posture (from #23)

Ship store-scoped entitlements (billing.md option 1): a Play purchase
unlocks on that device/account only and never mints a Lakeside
entitlement. The receipt bridge (option 2) is deferred until Play sales
exist; `EntitlementCache.receiptFor` preserves the signed receipt payload
the bridge endpoint will need.
