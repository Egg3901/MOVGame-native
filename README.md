# Native development moved to MOVGame

All Margin of Victory clients are now maintained together in
[Egg3901/MOVGame](https://github.com/Egg3901/MOVGame). Native source is in
[`apps/native`](https://github.com/Egg3901/MOVGame/tree/main/apps/native),
including Kotlin Multiplatform, Android Compose, iOS SwiftUI, and Tauri desktop.
Web source remains at the repository root. Build and signing workflows run there.

Use the MOVGame repository for new code, issues, and releases. This repository
is retained for historical commits and links; its source is no longer the
release target. Native history was preserved during the subtree import.

# Margin of Victory native clients

Android uses Kotlin Multiplatform for the simulation and Jetpack Compose for the interface. iOS uses the same KMP simulation with a SwiftUI interface. Neither mobile app runs the web UI or a Tauri wrapper. Desktop remains a Tauri shell around the [MOVGame](https://github.com/Egg3901/MOVGame) web client.

The store-visible package identifier remains `com.lakesidegames.electioneer`. The web game lives at `/games/electioneer/`.

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `shared/` | KMP simulation, content bundles, and entitlement policy |
| `androidApp/` | Compose screens and Play Billing adapter |
| `iosApp/` | SwiftUI screens and StoreKit adapter |
| `src-tauri/` | Desktop shell only |
| `web.pin` | Pinned MOVGame revision for desktop and exported native content |

The Kotlin engine is a port of MOVGame's TypeScript engine. Both implementations have cross-checked tests for deterministic behavior. Content bundles are exported from the pinned web revision. Any engine or content change must be compared against that revision and its calibration suite.

## Verify Android on Linux

```sh
npm run native:verify
```

This runs shared JVM tests and builds the Compose debug APK at `androidApp/build/outputs/apk/debug/androidApp-debug.apk`. Use `./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug` to install on a connected device. Android builds need JDK 21 and Android SDK platform 36.

The iOS app requires Xcode on macOS. Build the `MOVGameiOS` scheme in `iosApp/MOVGameiOS.xcodeproj`. Codemagic `ios-verify` compiles the simulator app without signing; `ios-testflight` is the signed upload route once Apple restores Developer Program access and the MOV profile and app record exist.

Desktop builds use `npm run desktop:build` or `npm run steam:build`. The desktop scripts fetch MOVGame at `web.pin`.

## Release status

The Android and iOS apps have native campaign menus, setup for all 17 U.S. scenarios, gameplay, results, and billing adapters. Local Android tests and APK builds pass; Codemagic compiles the iOS simulator app. Device testing, store products, purchase and refund exercises, privacy declarations, and signed release artifacts still need evidence before a store release. The SKU table is empty, so the apps currently sell no packs. See [release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md) for each gate.

The old Tauri Android and iOS configs remain as historical build artifacts; they are not mobile release targets.
